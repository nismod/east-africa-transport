# East Africa Transport Analysis

This is a project-specific repository for transport analysis in East Africa,
focussing on Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

The methodology of the model developed here is described in [Project Final Report](https://transport-links.com/download/final-report-decision-support-systems-for-resilient-strategic-transport-networks-in-low-income-countries/>`)

The results of the model are visualised here [East Africa Transport Risk Analysis tool](https://east-africa-infrastructureresilience.org)

## Development

Clone this repository using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or on
the command line:

    git clone git@github.com:nismod/east-africa-transport.git

Change directory into the root of the project:

    cd east-africa-transport

Optionally install python packages using pip:

    pip install geopandas fiona snkit tqdm

Alternativel it may be easier to install
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and then run

    conda env create -f .environment.yml
    conda activate east-africa-transport

Then
- `preprocess/osm/get_osm_data.sh` downloads OpenStreetMap extracts
- `preprocess/rail/rail.sh` extracts a connected and lightly cleaned rail network
