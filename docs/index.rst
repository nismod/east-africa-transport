This documentation describes the datasets assembled and created, with the Python scripts that require implementation for the analysis of the East Africa Transport Risk Analysis (EATRA).

The modelling and analysis aims to support decision-making by identifying the performance of
adaptation options under current and future scenarios. It comprises a network flow model,
generation of failure scenarios, economic impact assessment, and cost-benefit analysis of
adaptation options.


The methodology of the model developed here is described in `Project Final Report <https://transport-links.com/download/final-report-decision-support-systems-for-resilient-strategic-transport-networks-in-low-income-countries/>`_.

The results of the model are visualised here `East Africa Transport Risk Analysis Tool <https://east-africa-infrastructureresilience.org)>`_.
